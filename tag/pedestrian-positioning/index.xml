      <description>&lt;p&gt;Map-based indoor localization that reconciles the observations with the constraints provided by the maps in order to estimate the most trajectory, has drawn much attention in both civilian and military fields during the last decade. Unlike outdoor localization, it cannot adopt the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) owing to poor penetration. From the perspective of the pre-deployment hardware, indoor localization methods can be divided into two types&amp;amp;#58 deployment-dependent and deployment-independent positioning. A disadvantage to all deployment-dependent positioning methods is the tediousness and delicacy of the deployment process. In a typical deployment processes, a trainer should perform a careful survey of the environment. This includes going to a certain locations, collecting the value of some type of signals and repeating this for probably a large number of points whose locations are known by accurate measurements. This implies several hours or even days of data collection for radio-map of buildings. Most deployment-dependent algorithms need to update databases or maintain equipments. This requires a lot of manpower and material investment. additionally, deployment-dependent positioning will fail in specific scenarios where the facility cannot be deployed in advance. Therefore, this work focuses on map-based deployment-independent indoor positioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the key to providing accuracy indoor location, the map can be viewed as a geometric information providing spatial constraints. A floor plan of a building calibrates the movement of a user. For example, people can only enter the room through the door, not through the wall. However, most existing map matching methods rely on the external information of prior site survey or initial positions provided by users, which makes it challenging to meet on-demand localization requirements. Researchers have investigated the possibility of reducing reliance for initial positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the state-of-the-art researches, we explore a novel strategy for performing deployment-independent indoor positioning in this work. Here, we adopt easily accessible information such as floor plan and simple real-time images captured by smartphones to realize the user positioning by utilizing object recognition, video feature matching, and topological graphic matching all based on deep learning. In particular, topological graphic matching is based on the three-dimensional structure recovered from the floor plan and the spatial information directly extracted from the environmental picture. In summary, the main contributions of this paper are as follows&amp;amp;#58&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On-demand positioning system without initial constraint&amp;amp;#58 We design an indoor positioning system only utilizing map, Inertial Navigation System (INS) and videos to provide ON-DEMAND positioning service. Neither prior site survey nor initial positions from external information is needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Novel matching method guiding pedestrian positioning&amp;amp;#58 A novel method based on architectural perspective theory is designed to recover three-dimensional structure from floor plan. Besides, a Siamese Network has been employed to match the recovered three-dimensional structure with spatial information extracted from smartphone cameras.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensive experiments validation&amp;amp;#58 The proposed system demonstrates its performance in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness with a huge number of real-world experiment data in three different experiment scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Zero Velocity Detection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Indoor pedestrian tracking cannot count on Global Positioning System (GPS) owing to its poor penetration. Therefore, researchers have proposed various radio frequency localization systems (i.e., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ibeacon, etc.) for the indoor environment, but all require installation of infrastructure beforehand. The burden of deploying beacons or landmarks falls on such systems, which is unrealistic in some conditions, especially in the rescue scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) with inertial measurement units (IMU), as the self-contained navigation system without the requirement for ambient conditions, is a justifiable solution for general indoor localization. Nevertheless, the inertial navigation system (INS) calculates the relative displacement of an object that will result in accumulated errors due to the sensors&#39; drift. Stable trajectories could only maintain for a very short term using commercial IMU. To address this issue, foot-mounted IMU with zero velocity update (ZUPT) was proposed to eliminate the divergence of trajectory over time. The argument about attaching IMU to feet is that bipedal gait can split into two phases&amp;amp;#58 the stance phase and the swing phase. Under the assumption that the velocity is zero when the foot is stationary, it provides error-state Kalman Filter (ESKF), the drift corrector, pseudo-measurements to modify the position error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to ZUPT with ESKF is precise zero velocity detection that distinguishes the stationary phase from each stride. Due to the complex differences in pedestrian motion patterns, the hope is that the zero velocity detector becomes robust for various individuals. While using other sensors besides IMU can realize precise detection, these systems tend to be intricate because of synchronizing each module. Utilizing the raw IMU readings only, we present a novel approach leveraging deep learning (DL) to detect zero velocity adaptively. Trained by massive foot-mounted IMU data from different individuals, the symmetrical Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNNs) can effectively learn the law of gait because the model takes the information from forward to backward of the undetermined time instant into consideration. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in Symmetrical-Net extracts features and contextual information from input sequences, respectively. The proposed adaptive approach, unlike the conventional fixed threshold detector, requires no tuning on the optimal threshold, which will significantly elevate the applicability of ZUPT-aided INS. In summary, the main contributions of this project are as follows&amp;amp;#58&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robust and adaptive zero velocity detection&amp;amp;#58 Leveraging the neural network, more robust and adaptive zero velocity detection is realized compared with the fixed threshold. The symmetrical framework also guarantees precise detection regardless of motion types and individual differences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accurate and robust pedestrian tracking&amp;amp;#58 Performance of zero velocity detector makes a profound impact on the trajectory reconstruction of the ZUPT-aided INS system. The navigation system utilizing our proposed zero velocity detection shows significant improvement in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensive real-world validation&amp;amp;#58 Huge numbers of experiments reveal that INS assisted by Symmetrical-Net keep the high tracking accuracy in multiple indoor and outdoor environments under three paces (i.e., walking, fast walking, and running). Outstanding improvements, especially in robustness, on zero velocity detection via the proposed model are corroborated.&lt;/li&gt;
