      <description>&lt;p&gt;The proliferation of smartphones has significantly facilitated people’s life, and diverse and powerful embedded sensors make the smartphone a ubiquitous platform to acquire and analyze data, which also provides great potential for efficient human activity recognition. We propose a learning-based ensemble model to improve the recognition accuracy of human activities, especially those that are easily confused. In order to make the model more robust and generalized, a huge amount of motion data, including 100 participants aging from 12 to 51, is collected using ordinary smartphones at a sampling rate of 50Hz. This dataset contains 7 motion modes in 4 smartphone placements under 2 different collection platforms (IOS and Android).&lt;/p&gt;
