      <description>&lt;p&gt;To build an intelligent robotic positioning system that can more efficiently deal with the traditional SLAM problems such as camera calibration, monocular scale ambiguity, we explore a novel strategy for performing visual ego-motion estimation based on deep learning. Here, we extend the model into four branches focusing on pixels movement in different directions in the optical flow and then regress the global feature concatenated from the four outputs to obtain F2F motion estimation. In particular, features extracted by each branch have been distilled by using the attention mechanism to refine estimation. Experiments on the KITTI and Malaga benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art monocular methods by a large margin and produces competitive results against the classic stereo VO algorithm, which also highlights its promising generalization ability.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Loop Closure Detection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Loop Closure Detection (LCD), considered a key optimization part in the visual SLAM system, aims to recognize the places where a mobile robot previously visited. Correct loop closure detection benefits visual SLAM systems a lot because it can significantly reduce the position errors that accumulate over time. It enables the system to build a consistent map of the environment. We introduce the adaptive weighted similarity matrix by combining the feature extraction module and similarity measurement module to focus on changing appearance over time. Experiments on three typical open datasets are conducted to verify the feasibility of the proposed model.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This work focuses on map-based deployment-independent indoor positioning. Due to the fact that most existing map matching methods rely on the external information of prior site survey or initial positions provided by users, we explore a novel strategy for performing deployment-independent indoor positioning without considering start points. Here, we adopt easily accessible information such as floor plan and real-time video captured by smartphones to determine the location of the pedestrian for the following tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Zero Velocity Detection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Based on the fundamentals of human bipedal motion, Zero Velocity Update (ZUPT) is a pervasive approach in Pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) to tackle the accumulated error of IMU. The key to ZUPT is precise zero velocity detection that distinguishes the stationary phase from each stride. Besides, due to the complex differences in pedestrian motion patterns, the hope is that the zero velocity detector becomes robust for various individuals. We present a novel approach leveraging deep learning (DL) to detect zero velocity adaptively. Trained by massive foot-mounted IMU data from different individuals, the symmetrical Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNNs) can effectively learn the gait law because the model takes the information from forward to backward of the undetermined time instant into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Human Activity Recognition</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The proliferation of smartphones has significantly facilitated people’s life, and diverse and powerful embedded sensors make the smartphone a ubiquitous platform to acquire and analyze data, which also provides great potential for efficient human activity recognition. We propose a learning-based ensemble model to improve the recognition accuracy of human activities, especially those that are easily confused. In order to make the model more robust and generalized, a huge amount of motion data, including 100 participants aging from 12 to 51, is collected using ordinary smartphones at a sampling rate of 50Hz. This dataset contains 7 motion modes in 4 smartphone placements under 2 different collection platforms (IOS and Android).&lt;/p&gt;
